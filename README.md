QA Automation Task – Authorized Partner Signup
Project Overview

This project automates the complete signup process for the Authorized Partner platform:

https://authorized-partner.vercel.app/

The objective of this task was to automate the entire signup flow without any manual intervention, including OTP verification and form submissions across all steps. The automation is implemented using Playwright with Node.js.

The test simulates a real user journey from landing page to dashboard access, including logout and login verification to ensure end-to-end functionality.

Scope of Automation

The automation covers the full user lifecycle:

Landing Page

Navigates to the main website.

Clicks the “Join Us Now” button.

Terms and Conditions Page

Waits for the registration page to load.

Accepts the terms and conditions checkbox.

Clicks Continue.

Step 1 – Account Setup

Fills personal details (first name, last name, phone, password).

Uses a dynamically generated temporary email address.

Submits the form.

OTP Email Verification (Fully Automated)

Creates a temporary email account using mail.tm API.

Monitors the inbox for the OTP email.

Extracts the 6-digit OTP using regex.

Enters the OTP automatically.

Verifies the account without any manual input.

Step 2 – Agency Details

Fills agency information.

Selects regions of operation.

Proceeds to next step.

Step 3 – Professional Experience

Selects experience level.

Fills numeric and descriptive fields.

Selects services offered.

Step 4 – Verification and Preferences

Enters registration/reference details.

Selects preferred countries.

Uploads a generated dummy document file.

Submits the complete form.

Dashboard Verification

Verifies successful navigation to dashboard using URL assertion.

Takes screenshot as proof.

Logout Flow

Clicks logout.

Confirms logout in modal popup.

Verifies redirection to login page.

Login Flow

Logs in using the same dynamically created credentials.

Verifies successful redirection back to dashboard.

This ensures the automation validates:

Signup

OTP verification

Multi-step form handling

File upload

Dashboard access

Logout functionality

Login functionality

Session persistence

Key Implementation Details

Dynamic Test Data
Randomized test data is generated for each execution to avoid duplication issues and ensure repeatable runs.

Temporary Email Service
A temporary email account is created via API. The script authenticates with the service and polls the inbox until the OTP is received or timeout occurs.

OTP Extraction
The OTP is extracted using a regular expression that searches for a 6-digit numeric code inside the email body.

File Upload
A dummy PDF file is generated at runtime and uploaded in the verification step.

Assertions
URL-based assertions are used to confirm navigation to dashboard and login pages.

Reporting
Playwright HTML reporter, JSON report, screenshots, and execution video are enabled.
